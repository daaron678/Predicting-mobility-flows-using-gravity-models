To install scikit-mobility, python version must be greater than or equal to 3.7.

Installing with conda is easiest since it also manages pandas versions and other packages:
    Create a venv with 'conda create -n [choice name for venv] python=3.9.0'. Version 3.10.0 seemed incompatible with the pandas version installed with scikit-mobility.
    Activate with 'conda activate [choice name for venv]'
    Install scikit-mobility using conda-forge channel: 'conda install -c conda-forge scikit-mobility
    Use the kernel associated with the venv, VS Studio will ask user to install iPykernel.
